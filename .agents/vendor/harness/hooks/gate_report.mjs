/**
 * The machine-readable gate report: every gate the config declares, with a verdict.
 *
 * `verify.mjs` is a Stop *hook*: it runs only `STOP_KINDS`, it returns 0 when a gate could
 * not start, it never prints a `caveat`, and its output is prose on stderr. The `/verify`
 * skill prints caveats and covers `e2e`/`integration`, but its output is a chat message.
 * Neither is a machine record. This file is: one JSON document on stdout that says exactly
 * which gates ran, which passed, which were unavailable, which were not applicable, and
 * every caveat — the third of the three independent verification signals in §15.1.
 *
 * It reuses layer A rather than re-authoring it. `dispatch`, `gatedChange`, `isGated` and
 * `STOP_KINDS` come from `./verify.mjs`; `loadConfig`, `runArgv`, `repoRelative` and `tail`
 * come from `./lib.mjs`. No classification logic is copied, so the report and the Stop hook
 * cannot drift apart on what "this app was touched" or "this gate is opt-in" means. The
 * factory (layer D) reads this document; it must never re-derive which gates apply, because
 * that would re-author `dispatch()` and `STOP_KINDS` in Python where they would drift
 * silently — the single failure this repository exists to prevent.
 *
 * ```
 * node gate_report.mjs [--gate <name>]... [--all] [--json] [--base <ref>] [--cwd <dir>]
 * ```
 *
 * The `e2e`/`integration` gates are opt-in: without an assertion they are `not_applicable`,
 * because opt-in is not optional — the caller asserts a gate's `when` clause, and the factory
 * makes that decision from the agent's structured answer cross-checked by name against
 * `harness.config.json`'s own gates, never by pattern-matching the diff here.
 *
 * `--gate <name>` asserts **one** opt-in gate, and is repeatable. This is the form a machine
 * caller should use, because a `when` clause is prose (`"performance or accessibility budgets
 * are in scope"`) and nothing here can evaluate it — only the caller knows whether it holds,
 * and it holds per gate, not per run.
 *
 * `--all` asserts **every** opt-in gate at once. It is the interactive form — a human who
 * wants the full suite — and it is deliberately blunt: it does not re-read `when`, so it
 * asserts clauses the caller may not have meant. Measured on frontend-harness FRO-7,
 * 2026-08-22: an agent that honestly ran `playwright` forced `lighthouse` to run too, whose
 * `when` was plainly false for the change and which cannot pass on that machine at all
 * (its own caveat: the performance category scores null against the installed Chrome). The
 * run blocked on a gate that should never have executed. `--gate` is the repair; `--all`
 * keeps its meaning for the caller who really does want all of them.
 *
 * `--base <ref>` switches the "did this app change?" check from `git status --porcelain`
 * (uncommitted turn edits, what the Stop hook sees) to `git diff --name-only <base>..HEAD`
 * (the committed change since a base ref). The factory passes this — it commits the agent's
 * work before it verifies, so the working tree is clean and `git status` would see nothing;
 * against the run's base ref the diff sees the change instead. The Stop hook never passes
 * it, so its `gatedChange` is unchanged. See `gatedChangeSince` in `verify.mjs`.
 *
 * `--json` emits the document below. Without it, a compact human-readable summary goes to
 * stdout and the same exit code is returned, so an interactive run is legible without a
 * pipe. The factory always passes `--json`.
 *
 * ## Classification
 *
 * | status | Meaning |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | `pass` | exit 0, and the gate actually started |
 * | `fail` | non-zero exit |
 * | `unavailable` | the process could not be spawned (`result.error`) — the case `verify.mjs` must swallow and a report must not |
 * | `not_applicable` | `kind` is `e2e`/`integration` and the caller asserted neither `--gate <name>` nor `--all` |
 * | `skipped_unchanged` | the app's `gatedChange()` was false — a monorepo app the turn never touched |
 *
 * ## The verdict
 *
 * `verdict` is `pass`, `fail` or `incomplete`. It is **`incomplete` — never `pass`** when any
 * gate is `unavailable`, or when any app named in a root config had no config of its own.
 * That single rule is the whole answer to "a green exit code does not prove every relevant
 * gate ran": a gate that could not start is reported, never rounded to green.
 *
 * Exit codes are distinct so a caller that reads only the exit code still cannot mistake
 * incomplete for pass: `0` pass, `1` fail, `3` incomplete. A real `fail` outranks
 * `incomplete`, because a failing gate is the more actionable signal; the exit code is the
 * verdict's, with that precedence.
