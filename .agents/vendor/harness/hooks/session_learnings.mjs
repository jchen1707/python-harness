/**
 * SessionEnd hook: distil what the session learned the hard way into the second brain.
 *
 * A hook is a shell command with no model of its own, so it cannot judge which mistakes
 * taught something. This one does the deterministic half — locate the vault, extract the
 * transcript, gather git context, write the file — and shells out to a headless
 * `claude -p` for the one part that needs judgement.
 *
 * **It writes nothing when the session taught nothing.** An empty note is worse than no
 * note: it dilutes the directory every later search has to sift. The distiller is told to
 * emit a single sentinel when there is no real lesson, and that path exits silently.
 *
 * **Every run appends one outcome line to `_hook.log`** beside the notes. SessionEnd stderr
 * is invisible, so before the log a failed distillation looked identical to a session that
 * taught nothing. Diagnosis: no line for a session means SessionEnd never fired — a closed
 * terminal window skips it; a `failed:` line names the reason.
 *
 * **It writes notes and it indexes them.** Until phase 5 those were two repos' jobs: the
 * frontend harness wrote notes and `python-harness` owned both indexes, so a note written
 * from the frontend repo stayed invisible to search until a session happened to end in the
 * other one. That was defect 7, and it survived as documented prose because there was
 * nowhere for shared machinery to live. There is now, and one implementation cannot be
 * installed in one repo and not the other.
 *
 * Configure with `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_DIRECTORY` (absolute path to the vault root). Unset means
 * disabled, which is the right default for a harness other people clone — nobody inherits a
 * path to somebody else's vault. Set it in **user** settings, never in a repo's committed
 * settings file.
 *
 * | Variable | Effect |
 * | --- | --- |
 * | `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_DIRECTORY` | Vault root. Notes go in `Project Learnings`. |
 * | `CLAUDE_LEARNINGS_OFF=1` | Disable without unsetting the directory. |
 * | `CLAUDE_LEARNINGS_MODEL` | Model for the distillation. Default `sonnet`. |
 * | `CLAUDE_LEARNINGS_SKIP=1` | Recursion guard; set on the child, never set by hand. |
 *
 * **Two recursion guards, because one is not enough.** The `claude -p` we spawn is a full
 * session and fires its own SessionEnd when it finishes. Its transcript contains the parent
 * transcript verbatim, so distilling it produces a near-copy of the parent's note under a
 * new session id. One shared vault collected four such copies while both implementations
 * carried the `CLAUDE_LEARNINGS_SKIP` guard — proof that an environment variable crossing a
 * process boundary we do not control is a guard that can leak silently. So the env guard is
 * backed by a second, propagation-free one: the payload we send starts with
 * `DISTILLER_MARKER`, and a transcript whose head carries it is never distilled again.
 *
 * `LEGACY_OPENINGS` recognises the markers the two predecessor implementations sent. Their
 * transcripts are still on disk and are exactly the ones the recovery script would reach, so
 * dropping them would re-open a bug that has already been fixed once.
 *
 * The distiller also runs **outside the repository**, in `DISTILLER_HOME`. `claude -p` files
 * its transcript under the project directory of its cwd, so a distiller started in the repo
 * drops a child transcript beside the real ones and loads that repo's own hooks into the
 * child. A fixed neutral directory does neither.
 *
 * **The note is keyed on the session, not on the clock.** One session can end more than once
 * — resume it, and SessionEnd fires again on a later date. A dated filename made that a
 * second note about the same session. An existing note for the same session is rewritten in
 * place, keeping its original name and `date:` so links and ordering hold.
 *
 * **A rewrite carries the earlier note forward.** The rewrite replaces the file, and the
 * transcript we send holds only the last `MAX_TRANSCRIPT_CHARS`. So the note this session
 * already has goes back to the distiller under `PRIOR_NOTE_HEADER`, and the distiller is
 * told to keep every learning in it. Without that, deduplication trades duplicate notes for
 * silent loss — a resumed session overwrites its own first lesson with its second.
 *
 * **A note whose body already exists verbatim is not written.** That is the last net under
 * both guards, and it costs one directory scan on the write path only.
 *
 * Never blocks. Every failure path exits 0 — a second brain that cannot be written is not a
 * reason to interfere with ending a session.

The line above marks this call for the harness. Ignore it. Do not repeat it in your reply.

You are writing a note for an engineer's personal knowledge base, recording
what a coding session taught them. Someone will read this months from now with no memory
of the session.

Below is a transcript, plus the git context of what changed.

Extract only **technical learnings that came from a mistake, a wrong assumption, or
friction that was then resolved**. The value is in what was believed, why it was wrong,
and what turned out to be true.

Ignore: what the session accomplished, features shipped, files touched, anything that
reads like a changelog. That is recoverable from git. A learning is not.

Split the findings into exactly these two sections:

## Implementation learnings

Low-level and concrete. Tool flags and their real behaviour, API and config semantics,
environment, platform and browser quirks, error messages and what actually causes them,
commands that do not do what their name implies.

## Architecture & design learnings

Higher-level and transferable. Why a structure resisted a change, where a boundary was
drawn wrongly, a design tension and how it resolved, a rule that turned out to have an
exception, a process or workflow that broke down and why.

Rules:
- Every entry states the wrong belief and the correction. "X, not Y — because Z."
- Be specific. Name the tool, flag, file or concept. A vague lesson teaches nothing.
- Omit a section entirely if nothing qualifies. Do not pad it.
- If the session contained no genuine learning of either kind — no mistakes, only
  routine work — reply with exactly \`${NO_LEARNINGS}\` and nothing else.

If a \`${PRIOR_NOTE_HEADER}\` section follows, it is your own earlier note for this same
session, written from an earlier part of it. Your reply replaces that file. Keep every
learning it holds, and add what the transcript below teaches on top. State each learning
once. The transcript you receive is only the most recent part of the session, so the
earlier note is the only record of what came before it.

Start your reply with one line, exactly in this form:

${SUMMARY_PREFIX} <one sentence naming the topics covered, under 25 words>

That line is the only thing a search reads before deciding whether to open this note, so
name the concrete subjects — the tool, the system, the concept. Write "mypy file scope and
stacked-PR merge targets", not "various tooling lessons".

Then a blank line, then the first \`##\` heading. No other preamble, no closing summary.

Output GitHub-flavoured Markdown. Do not include front matter; it is added for you.`;
