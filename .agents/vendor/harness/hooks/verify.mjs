/**
 * Stop hook: refuse to end the turn while the Definition of Done is failing.
 *
 * Smart by design — the gates only run when the turn touched something that can actually
 * make them fail. That is the line: **code the gates check, plus the config that defines
 * the gates**. Prose, plans and docs still end freely, so writing work never burns toward
 * the 8-consecutive-block override Claude Code applies to Stop hooks.
 *
 * Which paths qualify is the consuming repo's declaration, in `harness.config.json` under
 * `hooks.gatedPaths`, `hooks.gatedFiles` and `hooks.gatedExtensions`. Both stacks arrived at
 * the same three groups by different routes, and the doctrine is worth restating because a
 * config is easy to narrow by accident:
 *
 * - The application and its tests.
 * - **The hooks themselves.** They are code the gates check, so a broken edit here fails
 *   the same gates as application code. Leaving them out meant the enforcement layer was
 *   the one thing the walk-away gate could not catch. Since phase 5 they are vendored
 *   rather than repo-owned, so what a stack gates is its own wiring — its settings file and
 *   its Codex adapter — plus the vendored tree, which its freshness check also covers.
 * - **The tool config that defines the gates.** A change to it can break every gate at once
 *   while touching no application code.
 *
 * The tradeoff this balances: widening the filter costs some override budget on config
 * work, but the excluded set that motivated the original narrow filter — Markdown, plans,
 * docs — is still excluded, and those are what sessions actually churn on.
 *
 * Convergence matters: every gate here is one an agent can actually fix. A check that can
 * never pass just wastes 8 turns of tokens before being overridden anyway.
 *
 * **Caveats are not printed here.** A gate's `caveat` names how it passes without having
 * checked anything, and the natural place to say so is beside a green result — but a Stop
 * hook that exits 0 has its stderr discarded, so printing them here reaches nobody. The
 * `/verify` skill prints them, because a human asked it a question and will read the
 * answer. What this hook adds instead is the other half: when it blocks, it names the
 * declared gates it did **not** run, so a passing subset is never mistaken for the whole
 * Definition of Done.
 *
 * **In a monorepo the gates dispatch by changed path.** A root config that names `apps`
 * delegates: each app declares its own Definition of Done, and a turn runs the gates of the
 * apps it actually touched. Running everything instead would make the monorepo cost what
 * split repos cost — a Python test suite on a CSS change — and running one app's gates from
 * the root would run them against the wrong tree. Which paths belong to which app needs no
 * new key: an app's own `gatedPaths` already says, and a path *outside* the app that it
 * names anyway — a shared contract package — is how both apps come to run when the contract
 * between them changed.
 *
 * Escape hatch: set `HARNESS_SKIP_VERIFY=1` to disable for a session. The legacy
 * `CLAUDE_SKIP_VERIFY` name remains supported — the gate is not Claude's, and naming it
 * after one harness is how the same escape hatch ended up with two names in two repos.
